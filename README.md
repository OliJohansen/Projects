# Projects
This repository contains my work in different areas of programming. The aim is to learn more about coding, and to contribute to other people's projects.

### About Me:
I am currently an informatics-student at the University of Oslo. I prefer subjects that require an understanding of algorithms and logical reasoning, though I would like to learn more about the designing- and front end-parts of programming.

### What Can You Find in this Repository?
- My work in subjects, such as an introductory class in Machine Learning and Aritificial Intelligence.
- Side-projects in areas I find interesting.

I will always try to document what I do thoroughly. If anything you see here is badly documented, or you have feedback concerning my documentation-methods, please contact me!

### Other Info:
- If you see potential improvements in my code, please contact me! I want to improve my coding, and feedback is always appreciated.
